Aqsis Rendering System INSTALL - Posix systems
-----------------------------------------------

* Generated files (e.g. configure, Makefile.in) are not stored in CVS; if you
are building from a CVS tree, you need to generate these files from the 
top-level directory:

	./bootstrap

* Now (regardless of where how you obtained the source), you need to configure
it for your system.  Note that currently shared libraries are turned-off by 
default, and the default install prefix is "/usr/local/aqsis". You can obtain a
listing of available configuration options by doing:

	./configure --help

* Once you've decided which (if any) configuration options you want to override,
you can run the configure script:

	./configure <options>

* Assuming there were no errors, you may now build the project:

	make

* Now, run the built-in tests, which will render a sample image of a vase and
teapot (ribfiles/vase.rib):

	make check

* You're now ready to install the Aqsis binaries for general use on your host.
You will have to have root access:

	su -c "make install"

* If you want to make a copy of the Aqsis source available for others, you can
roll your own distribution tarball:

	make distcheck

* Contact the Aqsis mailing list, <aqsis-development@lists.sourceforge.net> 
with any questions.
