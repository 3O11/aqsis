Todo:

	* Crude octree acceleration structure with aggregates represented simply
	  by points
	* Improved acceleration structure; better treatment for aggregates
	* Render colour (AOVs?) into microbuffer, integrate with BXDFs for colour
	  bleeding
	* Make old core to produce world space point clouds
	* Implement shadeops in shaderVM
	* Subsurface scattering integrator

Done:
	* Simple OpenGL ptc viewer application
	* Cornell box point cloud for testing
	* Render depth of points in a point cloud to a cube face microbuffer,
	  visualize in viewer.
	* Use depth microbuffer to compute AO for each point
