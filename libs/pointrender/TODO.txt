Implementation steps:

* Simple OpenGL ptc viewer application, generate Cornell box point cloud.

* Render depth of points in a point cloud to a cube face microbuffer, visualize in viewer.

* Use depth microbuffer to compute AO for each point

* Crude octree acceleration structure with aggregates represented simply by points

* Render colour (AOVs?) into microbuffer, integrate with BXDFs for colour bleeding

* Improved acceleration structure; better treatment for aggregates
