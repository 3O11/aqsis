Todo:

	* More BRDFs for colour bleeding (glossy BRDF?)
	* IBL via environment map lookup
	* Improve point access interface
	* Improved acceleration structure; better treatment for aggregates
	* Octree node cache and LRU rejection for improved memory footprint
	* Subsurface scattering integrator
        * Proper point cloud cache management
        * Point cloud viewer tool for users; use correct point size.
        * Use radius for nearby points, _area for distant ones.

Done:
	* Make old core to produce world space point clouds
	* Implement shadeops in shaderVM
	* Render colour into microbuffer for radiosity
	* Simple OpenGL ptc viewer application
	* Cornell box point cloud for testing
	* Render depth of points in a point cloud to a cube face microbuffer,
	  visualize in viewer.
	* Use depth microbuffer to compute AO for each point
	* Crude octree acceleration structure with aggregates represented simply
	  by points
