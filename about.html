Aqsis is a cross-platform photorealistic 3D rendering solution, adhering to the
RenderMan interface standard defined by Pixar Animation Studios.

The Aqsis project itself consists of a number of components, each useful in
their own right, but contributing to the larger aims of the project as a whole.
At this time, there are two such components: the aqsis rendering tools and the
RIBMosaic exporter for Blender. Each component has its own area detailed below.

This Wiki is the central location for all documentation and reference material
related to all Aqsis components. For further information about the product
itself, see the main web site http://www.aqsis.org.
