Aqsis is developed as an open source project distributed under the Gnu licensing  terms.&nbsp; The principal developer is Paul Gregory (pgregory@aqsis.com), and several other programmers have contributed tothe  project.<br>    <br>    MacAqsis is a version of the Aqsis software for the Mac OS X operating system.&nbsp; The MacAqsis distribution was prepared by Doug Ward (dsward@vidi.com).&nbsp;The VIDI 3D Team (http://www.vidi.com) plans to support Aqsis with modeling  and animation software in a future release.<br>    <br>   <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>   REQUIREMENTS -<br>   <br>   A Mac running Mac OS X 10.1 or newer<br>   <br>   The Mac OS X Developer Tools are required to execute the aqsl shader compiler. (The Developer Tools are available with Mac OS X, or can be downloaded from  <a href="http://www.apple.com/developer">http://www.apple.com/developer</a>   )<br>   <br>   3D modeling software capable of exporting RIB files for input to Aqsis, or a text editor to manually edit RIB files.<br>  <br>   Some basic experience with RenderMan software and the UNIX operating systemis helpful.<br>   <br>    <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>    MACAQSIS SOFTWARE -<br>    <br>  This release of MacAqsis software is operated by issuing commands through the  Mac OS X Terminal application.&nbsp; The two main programs are "aqsis"&nbsp;and the "aqsl" script.<br>    <br>    The 3D image rendering is performed by the "aqsis" program.&nbsp; The syntax  for starting the aqsis program is -<br>    <br>   <blockquote> <tt>aqsis input.rib</tt><br>     </blockquote>    <br>    where "input.rib" is the name of a RIB scene description file.&nbsp;The   output of aqsis is displayed in a window or written to a TIFF file,depending   on the "Display" command in the RIB file.<br>    <br>    An important component of the RenderMan standard is "shader" files.&nbsp;A shader is used to apply surface features to objects, define light sources,  and other scene components.&nbsp; Shaders are small programs written in"shader  language", and the "aqsl" script is used to convert them for usein rendering.&nbsp; The syntax for using aqsl is -<br>    <br>           <blockquote> <tt>aqsl input.sl</tt><br>       </blockquote>    <br>    where "input.sl" is the name of the shader language source code file.&nbsp;The output of aqsl is a compiled shader with the ".sl" extension changedto ".slx".<br>    <br>    Several other files are included with MacAqsis.&nbsp; These include programs  which are not intended to be started directly by the user, but are started  automatically by the main programs.&nbsp; The files include -<br>                   <blockquote> ddmsock.ini - This is a configuration file which specifies  the paths to the display device files.<br>       <br> .aqsisrc - This is a RIB header file to declare common shader variables andsearch paths. &nbsp;Because the file name starts with a period, this fileis invisible in the Finder window, but it can be seen in the Mac OS X Terminalapplication by using the "ls -a" command. &nbsp;The "less .aqsisrc" commandcan be used to view the file contents, and the "vi" editor can be used toedit the file.<br>    <br>    filebuffer.app - This program receives images from aqsis and stores them  in a TIFF file.<br>    <br>    framebuffer_glut.app - This program receives images from aqsis and displays  them in a window on the screen.<br>    <br>    shadowmap.app - aqsis uses this program prepares a "shadow map" for use  in casting shadows.<br>    <br>    teqser.app - aqsis uses the program to prepare "environment maps" tosimulate   reflections on objects.<br>    <br>    aqslcomp - This is the shader compiler program executed by the aqsl script.<br>    <br>    aqsltell - This program is used to "interrogate" a compiled shader and determine  the parameters that can be set by the user.&nbsp; Typically,it  is used by  modeling and animation programs to present a user interfacefor  setting shader  parameters.<br>         </blockquote>    <br>                            <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>    APPLICATION NOTES&nbsp; -<br>    <br>    A set of test files is included to demonstrate the capabilities of MacAqsis.  &nbsp;A test script is provided to compile several shaders and render some  images. &nbsp;To run the test script, execute this command in the Mac OS X Terminal application -<br>         <br>                           <blockquote><tt>sh ./MacAqsis-test.sh</tt><br>           </blockquote>    <br>    To use shaders with Aqsis, the aqsl shader compiler must be used.&nbsp; Compiled shaders from other sources (Pixar, Valis, etc.) cannot be used unless  the shader source code is available for input to aqsl.<br>    <br>    The Aqsis plug-ins to convert TIFF files to other formats (JPEG, GIF, etc.)  are not implemented in this release of MacAqsis.<br>    <br>                                    <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>    ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -<br>    <br>    For more information about Aqsis and RenderMan, consult these web sites  -<br>    <br>    Pixar - <a href="http://www.pixar.com">http://www.pixar.com</a>    <br>    <br>    Aqsis - <a href="http://www.aqsis.com">http://www.aqsis.com</a>    <br>    <br>    Aqsis Development Project - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aqsis/">    http://sourceforge.net/projects/aqsis/</a>    (Includes Aqsis discussion boards and mailing lists)<br>    <br>    RenderMan Repository - <a href="http://www.renderman.org">http://www.renderman.org</a>    <br>    <br>    RenderMan Newsgroup - <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;group=comp.graphics.rendering.renderman">    http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;group=comp.graphics.rendering.renderman</a>    <br>    <br>    Exluna's information links - <a href="http://www.exluna.com/products/links.html">    http://www.exluna.com/products/links.html</a>    <br>    <br>  Questions about the MacAqsis version of Aqsis may be e-mailed to <a href="mailto:dsward@vidi.com">  dsward@vidi.com</a>          <br>          <br>                                    <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>    Pixar and RenderMan are trademarks of Pixar Animation Studios.                                   </body>        </html>
