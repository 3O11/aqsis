(The Developer Tools are available with Mac OS X, or can be downloadedfrom   <a href="http://www.apple.com/developer">http://www.apple.com/developer</a>    )<br>    <br>    3D modeling software capable of exporting RIB files for input to Aqsis,  or a text editor to manually edit RIB files.<br>   <br>    Some basic experience with RenderMan software and the UNIX operatingsystem is helpful.<br>    <br>     <hr width="100%" size="2"><br><a name="about"></a>ABOUT THE MACAQSIS SOFTWARE AND FILES -<br>     <br>   This release of MacAqsis software is operated by issuing commands through  the  Mac OS X Terminal application.&nbsp; The two main programs are "aqsis"&nbsp; and the "aqsl" script.<br>     <br>     The 3D image rendering is performed by the "aqsis" program.&nbsp; The syntax  for starting the aqsis program is -<br>     <br>    <blockquote> <tt>aqsis input.rib</tt><br>      </blockquote>     <br>     where "input.rib" is the name of a RIB scene description file.&nbsp; The   output of aqsis is displayed in a window or written to a TIFF file, depending   on the "Display" command in the RIB file.<br>     <br>     An important component of the RenderMan standard is "shader" files.&nbsp; A shader is used to apply surface features to objects, define light sources,   and other scene components.&nbsp; Shaders are small programs written in "shader  language", and the "aqsl" script is used to convert them for use in rendering.&nbsp; The syntax for using aqsl is -<br>     <br>              <blockquote> <tt>aqsl input.sl</tt><br>        </blockquote>     <br>     where "input.sl" is the name of the shader language source code file.&nbsp; The output of aqsl is a compiled shader with the ".sl" extension changed to".slx".<br>     <br>     Several other files are included with MacAqsis.&nbsp; These includeprograms   which are not intended to be started directly by the user, butare started   automatically by the main programs.&nbsp; The files include-<br>                        <blockquote> ddmsock.ini - This is a configuration file which specifies  the paths to the display device files.<br>        <br>  .aqsisrc - This is a RIB header file to declare common shader variablesand search paths. &nbsp;Because the file name starts with a period, thisfile is invisible in the Finder window, but it can be seen in the Mac OSX Terminal application by using the "ls -a" command. &nbsp;The "less .aqsisrc"command can be used to view the file contents, and the "vi" editor can beused to edit the file.<br>     <br>     filebuffer.app - This program receives images from aqsis and storesthem   in a TIFF file.<br>     <br>     framebuffer_glut.app - This program receives images from aqsis and displays   them in a window on the screen.<br>     <br>     shadowmap.app - aqsis uses this program prepares a "shadow map" foruse   in casting shadows.<br>     <br>     teqser.app - aqsis uses the program to prepare "environment maps" to simulate   reflections on objects.<br>     <br>     aqslcomp - This is the shader compiler program executed by the aqslscript.<br>     <br>     aqsltell - This program is used to "interrogate" a compiled shader and  determine  the parameters that can be set by the user.&nbsp; Typically, it is used by  modeling and animation programs to present a user interface for setting shader  parameters.<br>          </blockquote>     <br>                                   <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>      <a name="appnotes"></a>     APPLICATION NOTES&nbsp; -<br>     <br>     A set of test files is included to demonstrate the capabilities of MacAqsis.  &nbsp;A test script is provided to compile several shaders and render some  images. &nbsp;To run the test script, execute this command in the Mac OS X Terminal application -<br>          <br>                                  <blockquote><tt>sh ./MacAqsis-test.sh</tt><br>            </blockquote>     <br>     To use shaders with Aqsis, the aqsl shader compiler must be used.&nbsp;Compiled shaders from other sources (Pixar, Valis, etc.) cannot be used unless  the shader source code is available for input to aqsl.<br>     <br>     The Aqsis plug-ins to convert TIFF files to other formats (JPEG, GIF, etc.)  are not implemented in this release of MacAqsis.<br>     <br>        <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>        <br>        <a name="build"></a>BUILDING &nbsp;MACAQSIS FROM SOURCE CODE -<br>        <br>This method of building MacAqsis does not use the standard Makefiles. &nbsp;Instead,it uses Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/projectbuilder/">Project Builder</a> system.&nbsp; It builds some of the programs as "app" packages in orderto work correctly in the Mac OS X execution environment.&nbsp; <br>        <br>Before building MacAqsis, there are a couple of static libraries that arerequired. &nbsp;Obtain and install these libraries -<br>        <br>        <b>libargparse</b> - Available from: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=25264&amp;release_id=53843">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=25264&amp;release_id=53843<br>        </a>        <br>        <b>libtiff</b> - Available from: <a href="http://www.libtiff.org/">http://www.libtiff.org/</a>        <br>        <br>After installation, they should be located at /usr/local/lib/libargparse.aand /usr/local/lib/libtiff.a.<br>        <br>Next, obtain the Aqsis source code from a source code snapshot archive orthe CVS repository at the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aqsis/">Aqsis project</a> web site.<br>        <br>To build from the Aqsis CVS, checkout the "renderer" and "MacAqsis" directories.&nbsp;Both of those directories should be contained within the same parentdirectory.&nbsp; <br>        <br>The MacAqsis directory contains MacAqsis-pbproj.tar.gz and&nbsp; makedist-MacAqsis.sh.&nbsp;StuffIt Expander is the recommended application for decompressing the MacAqsis.pbprojfile.<br>        <br>Open the MacAqsis.pbproj file and follow these instructions -<br>        <br>1. Execute the Clean All Targets command.<br>2. Set the Active Target to "librib2" and execute the "Build Active Target"command.<br>3. Set the Active Target to "libslparse" and execute the "Build Active Target"command.<br>4. Set the Active Target to "all" and execute the "Build Active Target" command.<br>        <br>Finally, use the Mac OS X Terminal application to perform the final steps-<br>        <br>sh ./makedist-MacAqsis.sh<br>        <br>It will create a "MacAqsis-dist" folder in the MacAqsis directory and stripany debugging symbols from the executable files. <br>        <br>The MacAqsis-dist folder ready to go with some RIB files, shaders and a testscript to verify that it works correctly. &nbsp;Use the Mac OS X Terminalapplication to execute this script to test the installation -<br>        <br>sh ./MacAqsis-test.sh<br>        <br>                                             <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>        <a name="additional"></a>     ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -<br>     <br>     For more information about Aqsis and RenderMan, consult these web sites  -<br>     <br>     Pixar - <a href="http://www.pixar.com">http://www.pixar.com</a>     <br>     <br>     Aqsis - <a href="http://www.aqsis.com">http://www.aqsis.com</a>     <br>     <br>     Aqsis Development Project - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aqsis/">     http://sourceforge.net/projects/aqsis/</a>     (Includes Aqsis discussion boards and mailing lists)<br>     <br>     RenderMan Repository - <a href="http://www.renderman.org">http://www.renderman.org</a>     <br>     <br>     RenderMan Newsgroup - <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;group=comp.graphics.rendering.renderman">     http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;group=comp.graphics.rendering.renderman</a>     <br>     <br>     Exluna's information links - <a href="http://www.exluna.com/products/links.html">     http://www.exluna.com/products/links.html</a>     <br>     <br>   Questions about the MacAqsis version of Aqsis may be e-mailed to <a href="mailto:dsward@vidi.com">   dsward@vidi.com</a>           <br>           <br>                                             <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>        <p><i>The RenderMan&reg; Interface Procedures and RIB Protocol are:Copyright         &copy; 1987, 1988, 1989, 1995 Pixar.
