Some things which should be done:

* Handle primvars and AOVs
* Implement a basic shader interface
* Supersampling and output image filtering
* Tile-based allocation for sample points
* Efficient Motion Blur and Depth of Field sampling
* Transparency - deep fragment buffer
* Grid crack solution via stitching
* Bucket rendering
* Occlusion culling


Things which are more or less speculative / require research

* Arbitrary bucket orders
* Multithreaded bucket rendering
* Output of deep data
* Raytracer prototype
