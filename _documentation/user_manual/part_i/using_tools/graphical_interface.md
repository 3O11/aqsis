Overview
--------

Eqsl ("excel") is a graphical user interface which allows easy/fast access to
the most commonly-used tools within the Aqsis suite.

Designed to be small and efficient it currently allows:

  * Rendering files via aqsis.
  * Compiling shaders via aqsl.
  * Opening the piqsl advanced framebuffer.

This list may grow as the tool evolves, possibly including commonly-used
operations (like texture optimisation).
