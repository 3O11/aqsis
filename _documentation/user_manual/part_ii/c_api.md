The RenderMan Interface comes in two flavours; even though RenderMan renderers
are often used via RIB files or streams, there is also a C API.  This API is
documented in detail in [the official
specification](https://renderman.pixar.com/products/rispec/index.htm); the aqsis
conformance with the standard is documented elsewhere in this manual.

FIXME This page should contain details relevant to linking with and generally
using the aqsis C libraries, libaqsis and libri2rib.
