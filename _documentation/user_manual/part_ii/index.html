<p>
This documentation section is aimed at users of the Aqsis tools, as opposed to
those contributing to the development. This does not mean that it does not
contain any highly technical information, in fact the nature of the Aqsis
product requires a level of technical ability and this documentation also
covers the use of the libraries and integration tools provided as part of the
suite. The level of technical understanding required differs throughout the
manual.
