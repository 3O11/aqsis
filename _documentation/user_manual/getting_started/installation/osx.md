Aqsis is available as a '[Universal](http://www.apple.com/universal)' binary
from [SourceForge](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/aqsis).

Once the disk image (*.dmg) is mounted you can launch the 'Aqsis' application,
and optionally install it in the "Applications" folder. When launched, the
application provides the option to either open an Aqsis shell or open the
graphical front-end ''<span style="color:red">eqsl</span>''.

<p>
The Aqsis shell updates the session <code>PATH</code> and <code>AQSISHOME</code> environment
variables on each execution, meaning the application bundle can be safely moved
around your system without breaking functionality.
