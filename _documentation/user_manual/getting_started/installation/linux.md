Aqsis is part of the official package repositories for a number of Linux
distributions, including Fedora, openSUSE, Debian (including Ubuntu) and Gentoo.
Most users can refer to their native package manager to install Aqsis.

<p>
As of October 2009, these Linux distribution packages are very <em>outdated</em>
and still contain version 1.2 of Aqsis. Currently there are no installation
packages for Linux provided on our SourceForge site. Therefore, the instructions
in this section should be disregarded for now. Please refer to our <span
style="color:red">instructions on how to build Aqsis 1.6 from source</span>. The
instructions found above for Windows and MacOS X are still correct and will
install Aqsis version 1.6.
