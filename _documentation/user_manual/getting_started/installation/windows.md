stage of installation. 

![Installation Screen 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/windows_install_3.png) 

You have the option to add the location of the Aqsis executables to your system
''PATH'', so that they will be found automatically from the command line. This
screen offers three choices

- Do not modify `PATH` at all, leaving it up to you to deal with location of
  the executable when using them from the command line. 
- Modify the `PATH` at a system level, so that all users will have access to
  the executables from the command line.
- Modify the `PATH` for just the currently logged in user.

Make your choice and then select Next to continue with the installation process.

find the location using a standard file selector. When you have chosen the
installation location, select Next to continue.
