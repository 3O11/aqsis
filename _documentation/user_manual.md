User Manual
===========

This documentation section is aimed at users of the Aqsis tools, as opposed to those contributing to the development. This does not mean that it does not contain any highly technical information, in fact the nature of the Aqsis product requires a level of technical ability and this documentation also covers the use of the libraries and integration tools provided as part of the suite. The level of technical understanding required differs throughout the manual.
